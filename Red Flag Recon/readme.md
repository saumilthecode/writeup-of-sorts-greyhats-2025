# Red Flag Recon

chal :
> Since announcing GreyCTF, we've noticed persistent comments on the GreyHats Instagram account from a user keen to create a challenge for us. But with GreyCTF so close to our final exams, we haven't had the bandwidth to properly vet him. Help us check him out, make sure there are no red flags.

>Note: There is only one flag in this challenge. If it fits the flag format grey{...}, you've likely got it!

So cutting to the chase, you'd need to first start by checking the GreyCTF instagram where clicking on the first post results in this comment from ``ducati777__``
